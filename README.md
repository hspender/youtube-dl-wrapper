::NOTE:: There's currently an issue with this script that may be an update to youtube-dl.<br />
I'm investigating the issue...<br />

::About::<br />

youtube-dl wrapper is a script that makes using youtube-dl a little easier, but is basically just an exsercise in learing Git and Bash for me.<br />
I hope to upadate and improve its code as well as maybe adding a Zenity front end one day.

::Installation::<br />

To install, just run the install script in the main directory. This will check to see if you have youtube-dl installed and install it if you don't.<br />
I have chosen to download youtube-dl directly from their release page, but you can install it from your distro's repo' before installing this script if you'd rather.<br />
Note that my script does keep youtube-dl up to date by periodically checking the main repo for updates and applying them if needed.
